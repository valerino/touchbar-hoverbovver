# Touchbar Hover Bovver

## WTF ?!?
Just a quick touchbar hack :)

## but ... why ?
Coz it was missing :) I made it mostly as a tribute to Jeff Minter of LLamasoft !

## Why Hover Bovver ?
My dad, who's now in a better place probably (ciao Enzo!), bought me the tape back in 1983. 

It was my first videogame ever on C64, the one i remember the most.

## How it looks like

## How to use it
Load project in XCode, build, run... and watch the touchbar, nothing else :)
